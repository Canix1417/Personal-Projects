This folder holds all the material needed to create my first website using
ASP.Net Core. The project followed a MVC architecture and the content for the website was actually taken from following
the Microsoft tutorial for ASP.NET Core MVC.
The tutorial can be found https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio

This was definitely a fun learning experience!
